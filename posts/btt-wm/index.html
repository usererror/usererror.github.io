<p>MacOS does not support snapping or moving windows around at all. If you come from the Linux world and are fond of tiling window managers like <code>i3</code>, you are in for serious frustration. The solution is to use two applications:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://folivora.ai/">BetterTouchTool</a> is a fantastic MacOS utility tool that can act as a window manager among other things. It is no longer a free application but does come with a 45-day free trial and a reasonable price tag.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements">Karabiner-Elements</a> is another great MacOS utility tool that can customize your keyboard by mapping keys to other keys and even key combinations. Karabiner-Elements is free and open source software.</li>
</ol>

<p>The easiest way to install BetterTouchTool and Karabiner-Elements is with <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">brew cask install bettertouchtool karabiner-elements
</code></pre>

<h2 id="define-a-hyper-key">Define a &ldquo;Hyper&rdquo; Key</h2>

<p>A &ldquo;Hyper Key&rdquo; is a single key that transmits the  <code>^ + ⌥  + ⇧ + ⌘</code> key combination when pressed. Karabiner-Elements can configure the <code>Caps Lock</code> key to send <code>Esc</code> when pressed by itself and the Hyper combination <code>^ + ⌥ + ⇧ + ⌘</code> when held down and used with other keys such as <code>H</code>, <code>J</code>, <code>K</code>, and <code>L</code>. The Hyper key configuration I use to accomplish this is <a href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/complex_modifications/#caps_lock">here</a>. Clicking the blue <code>Import</code> button adds this configuration to Karabiner-Elements automatically.</p>

<p>The reason you need a Hyper key at all is that many MacOS applications (and the OS itself) define shortcuts that use simple modifier combinations like <code>^ + ⇧</code> and <code>⌥ + ⌘</code> which often interfere with shortcuts defined in BetterTouchTool that use the same modifiers. By configuring a Hyper key and using it in BetterTouchTool all of the inconsistent behavior, shortcut interference, and nightmarish error bells can be avoided.</p>

<h2 id="create-bettertouchtool-shortcuts">Create BetterTouchTool Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Adding new keyboard shortcuts in BetterTouchTool is relatively easy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click the <code>Gestures/Triggers</code> button (with the animal paw icon) and then select <code>Keyboard</code> from the toolbar.</li>
<li>Click the <code>+ Add New Shortcut or Key Sequence</code> button.</li>
<li>Select the <code>Shortcut</code> option on the bottom left of the app above the entry box.</li>
<li>Click on the entry box and type the new shortcut.</li>
<li>Set the shortcut to trigger a predefined action on the right-hand side of the app. The actions relevant to this post are under the <code>Window Resize &amp; Move</code> category.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, by pressing <code>Hyper + H</code> during step 4, you can create a new shortcut that is triggered by the <code>Hyper + H</code> key combination. The Hyper key will show up in BetterTouchTool as the full <code>^ + ⌥  + ⇧ + ⌘</code> key combination.</p>

<p>The shortcuts I have set up show some useful but straightforward window management commands BetterTouchTool provides. These shortcuts let me easily snap windows around with the Hyper key and standard Vim movement keys:</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>Once the <code>Caps Lock</code> key is upgraded to a &ldquo;Hyper Key&rdquo;, moving windows around is dead easy. The shortcuts in the screenshot above become <code>Hyper + {H,J,K,L}</code>. As an added bonus, the Hyper key is also useful in Vim since it transmits the <code>Esc</code> key when pressed by itself, preventing repeatedly reaching for the actual <code>Esc</code> key with your pinky finger (a common source of RSI and wrist strain). The Hyper key can be used for any shortcuts you want to be available system-wide without interfering with the operating system and your applications shortcuts; this post is just the tip of the iceberg!</p>
